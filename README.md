    - **Delete Goals:** Remove completed or obsolete goals from their list, keeping their dashboard clutter-free.
      
- **Priority**: Users can assign priority levels to their goals, allowing them to prioritize their efforts effectively.
  
- **Completion Time**: Users can associate a deadline with the goal

- - **Sorting**: Sort the goal on a variety of its properties like priority, completion time, creation time, days left, age, and aged priority.

- **Priority Ageing**: Does aging sounds familiar? It will if you have studied process scheduling algorithms in OS. Aging solves a critical problem of starvation, in which ready-to-run processes are not able to acquire the CPU. To prevent this, their priority is increased periodically. Taking inspiration from this, in this app priority of the goals, will keep increasing as the deadline comes closer. This prevents procrastination and allows the users to focus on the most important tasks.
