# Strive, Thrive, Achieve: GoalSetterðŸŽ¯ - Your Ambition Ally!
Welcome to GoalSetterðŸŽ¯! <br><br>

This is a MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) web application designed to help users set, track, and achieve their personal goals. GoalSetter provides a user-friendly interface where individuals can register an account, log in securely, and manage their goals effectively. With features like goal creation, update, read, and deletion, GoalSetter empowers users to stay focused and organized on their journey toward success.<br><br>

But apart from being a complete CRUD app with user authentication, it also includes an exciting feature - aging! Sounds familiar? It will if you have studied process scheduling algorithms in OS. <br> Aging solves a critical problem of starvation in priority scheduling, and taking this inspiration, this application dynamically increases goal priorities over time, encouraging users to take action on long-standing goals and avoid procrastination. As goals age, their priorities are automatically boosted, ensuring that users maintain focus on both time-sensitive and older objectives.

# Features
- **User Authentication** - GoalSetter offers a robust user authentication system that ensures secure access to the app. 
  - Register: Users can register their accounts using a unique email address and password.
  - Login: Subsequently, log in with their credentials.
  - Authentication is implemented with the help of JWT tokens. The user remains signed in until he closes the tab.
  - Various checks on login and register forms are added to ensure robustness.

- **Goal Management** - Once logged in, users gain access to their personalized dashboard. From here, they can easily<p>
    - **Add Goals:** Create new goals by specifying goal detail.
    - **Update Goals:** Modify existing goals..
    - **Read Goals**: View a comprehensive list of all their goals.
    - **Delete Goals:** Remove completed or obsolete goals from their list, keeping their dashboard clutter-free.
      
- **Priority** - Users can assign priority levels to their goals, allowing them to prioritize their efforts effectively.
  
- **Completion Time** - Users can associate a deadline with the goal
